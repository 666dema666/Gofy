Arkham Horror Card Game

Migration board game on Delphi. Using DGLE2 2D-engine.

Now I implementing a card storing method (to store cards in separate files, not in code). No graphics at all. For graphics in game responsible another man and it's allmost ready, no big deal actually (laborious but easy).
